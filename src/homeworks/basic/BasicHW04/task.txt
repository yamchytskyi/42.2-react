2. Fixed Header (position: fixed)

    Create a Header component that stays at the top of the page when scrolling.

    Ensure no content hides behind it (adjust body padding).

3. Client Cards (position: relative)

    Create a ClientCard component with:

        Dimensions: 400px × 500px.

        Styling: Unique border style for each card (solid, dashed, dotted).

        Content: Name, photo (placeholder), age, gender.

    Position cards in a staircase layout (each card offset diagonally).

4. Positioning Subtasks

Add these to the page to demonstrate all positioning types:
A. Static Square (Default)

    A div with no explicit positioning (ignores top/right/bottom/left).

B. Relative + Absolute Squares

    A relative parent div (300px × 300px) containing an absolute child div (100px × 100px) positioned at bottom: 10px; right: 20px.

C. Sticky Sidebar

    A tall aside that becomes sticky after scrolling past the header.

    Inside, include:

        A static square (default flow).

        An absolute square positioned at top: 0; right: 0 (relative to the sidebar).

D. Fixed Footer

    A footer fixed to the bottom of the viewport.

E. Absolute Overlay

    A div positioned absolutely in the corner of the page (top: 200px; right: 50px).

Interviewer’s Evaluation Criteria

    Correct Positioning:

        Does each element behave as expected (e.g., sticky sidebar sticks, fixed header doesn’t overlap)?

    React Best Practices:

        Are components reusable? Is state/props used effectively for card data?

    Layout Integrity:

        Does the staircase card layout work? Is there unwanted overlap?

    Code Structure:

        Are styles scoped properly (CSS Modules/Styled Components)?

    Attention to Detail:

        Are offsets (e.g., body padding for fixed header/footer) handled?

Bonus Questions (Interview Follow-Up)

    How would you make this responsive?

        Consider mobile layouts for the staircase cards.

    When would you use position: sticky vs fixed?

        Compare use cases (e.g., sticky navbars vs fixed footers).

    How does stacking context affect z-index here?

        Discuss how positioned elements layer (e.g., header/footer z-index).

Deliverable

A single React app with:

    A fixed header.

    Three relatively positioned client cards in a staircase.

    All five positioning examples (static, relative, absolute, sticky, fixed).

    No layout bugs or overlapping issues.

Time Limit: 1 hour (interview setting) or 2 hours (take-home).
